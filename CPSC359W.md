### Week of January 21st:
This week we'll practice what you learned in last week's lectures. That means we will:

- Practice translating between three different representations of boolean functions, i.e.,
 > logic diagrams <--> algebraic expression <--> truth tables.

- Practice minimizing the number of literals and terms in boolean functions using axioms and theorems of boolean algebra.

- Practice finding the complements of boolean functions using two methods, i.e.,
  * application of axioms and theorems, and
  * by the "shortcut method" (find the dual and complement each literal).

Please bring pencil and paper to work on practice problems.

Here are all the maths you need to know for digital logic.
