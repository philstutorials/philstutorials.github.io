# CPSC 359: Computing Machinery II (Winter 2019)

Tutorials:  
**T04** - Monday, Wednesday: 11:00am-11:50am (MS 252)  
**T03** - Tuesday, Thursday: 11:00am-11:50am (MS 252)

### Week of January 21st:
This week we'll practice what you learned in last week's lectures. That means we will:

- Practice translating between three different representations of boolean expressions, i.e.,
 > logic (circuit) diagrams <--> algebraic expressions <--> truth tables.

- Practice minimizing the number of literals and terms in boolean expressions using axioms and theorems of boolean algebra.

- Practice finding the complements of boolean expressions using two methods, i.e.,
  * application of axioms and theorems, and
  * by the "shortcut method" (find the dual and complement each literal).

Please bring pencil and paper to work on practice problems.

Here is are all the maths you need to know for digital logic.

### Week of January 28st:
During the first tutorial we will practice minimizing three and four variable Boolean functions using the map method.

The second tutorial is dedicated to familiarizing ourselves with Logisim. Your first two assignments will require that you use this.

This is what Karnaugh maps look like..
