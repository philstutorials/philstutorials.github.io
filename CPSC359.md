# CPSC 359: Computing Machinery II (Fall 2018)

Tutorials: Tuesday, Thursday: 12:00pm-12:50pm (MS 252)


### September 18th and 20th:
This week we'll practice what you learned in last week's lectures. That means we will:

- Practice translating between three different representations of boolean functions, i.e.,
 > logic diagrams <--> algebra <--> truth tables.

- Practice minimizing the number of literals and terms in boolean functions using axioms and theorems of boolean algebra.

- Practice finding the complements of boolean functions using two methods, i.e.,
  * application of axioms and theorems, and
  * by the "shortcut method" (find the dual and complement each literal).

Please bring pencil and paper to work on practice problems.

### September 25th and 27th:
On Tuesday we will practice minimixing three and four variable Boolean functions using the map method.

On Thursday we will become familiar with the Logisim application.

----
### October 2nd and 4th:
On Tuesday we will apply the design process to a simple example.

On Thursday we will finish our assignments.

----

### October 9th and 11th:
On Tuesday we will build various latches in Logisim.

On Thursday we will create various flip-flops.

----

### October 16th and 18th:
On Tuesday we will analyze a clocked sequential circuit.

> Using a principled analysis process we discovered that the [sequential circuit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philstutorials/philstutorials.github.io/master/_data/analyze_this.circ "Logisim file, Save to your computer") outputs 1 after it's seen 4+, consecutive, inputs of 1.

On Thursday we will design and implement a sequential circuit.
