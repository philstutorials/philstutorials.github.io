# CPSC 359: Computing Machinery II (Fall 2018)

Tutorials: Tuesday, Thursday: 12:00pm-12:50pm (MS 252)


### Week 1 Plan:
- Practice translating between three different representations of boolean functions, i.e., algebra <> truth tables <> logic diagrams.

- Practice minimizing the number of literals and terms in boolean functions using a few axioms and theorems of boolean algebra.

- Practice finding the complements of boolean functions using two methods, i.e.,
  * by application of a few axioms and theorems, and
  * by the "shortcut method" (find the dual and complement each literal).

Please bring pencil and paper to work on practice problems.
