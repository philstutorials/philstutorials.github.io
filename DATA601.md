## Some considerations about looking up available operations, their names, and parameters

When you're writing your own code in a jupyter notebook it's useful to develop your own heuristic for looking things up. From my experience I would start with a strategy something like this:

1. When you have **no idea** if you're looking for functionality provided by the python language or a part of some library:
 > Google your vague questions then go to 2, 3, 4, or 5.

2. When you **know who provides** the functionality you're looking for (e.g.  python, matplotlib, pandas, etc) but you don't really know what it would be:
 > Skim the tutorial in the documentation.

3. When you **know who and what** you're looking for but can't remember the function name or parameters
 > Go to the documentation's tutorial or reference.

4. When you **know the name** of a function but can't remember the parameters:
 > `?data.function_name <CTRL>+<ENTER>` in your jupyter notebook or go to the documentation's reference page.

5. When you **want to remind yourself** of the available operations on a particular data structure:
  > `object. <TAB>`.

 
This strategy is motivated by the fact that information returned from a google search may be out of date.
In other words the version of software (python, anaconda, or the python related libraries) **you're** using is different than the version **they're** using at the time that generous stranger posted an answer in a Q&A community.
The details of parameters may be different in your version or some functions may be depreciated in your version and the developers of the language/libraries may have created a completely new way to do what you want that's simpler but wasn't available before.

If you followed the anaconda installation instructions provided on D2L, for your first assignment, you only need to refer to the *latest* python and matplotlib documentation:
* [Python 3.6.6 Documentation (see Tutorial, Library Reference, and Language Reference)](https://docs.python.org/3.6/index.html)
* [Matplotlib 2.2.3 (see User's Guide>Tutorials and The Matplotlib API)](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html)
